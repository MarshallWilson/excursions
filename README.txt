This project is a successful implementation of a responsive static website, meticulously recreated from a provided design specification. The goal was to convert a visual blueprint, complete with precise CSS property outlines, into clean, functional, and visually faithful HTML and CSS code.

Project Goals & Focus Design-to-Code Fidelity: The primary challenge was translating the exact aesthetic and layout defined in the design spec, demonstrating the ability to work with rigid external requirements. Fundamental Skill Proficiency: Solidification of core HTML5 structure and advanced CSS3 techniques, including layout management (Flexbox/Grid), spacing, typography, and color handling. Adherence to Best Practices: Code is semantic, well-organized, and easily maintainable, simulating a real-world workflow where design assets are handed off by a dedicated design team.

Key Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated Area Concepts Implemented Structure Semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility and clear document outline. Styling Advanced CSS selectors, use of CSS variables (if applicable), and attention to detail for spacing and box model properties. LayoutImplementation of a responsive design to ensure optimal display across various screen sizes (using media queries).

Workflow Disciplined development process: using the design spec as the single source of truth for all styling and layout values.
